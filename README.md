# Portfolio Optimization With GA(Genetic Algorithm) and MCMC(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) Algorithm

### Description
#### _These two python projects shows the implementation and usage of GA(Genetic Algorithm) and MCMC(Markov Chain Monte Carlo)._
#### MCMC: It is a type of stochastic optimization algorithm that generates a sequence of portfolios (states) where each portfolio depends only on the previous one, which is the characteristic of a Markov chain.
#### GA: It is a type of stochastic optimization algorithm that generates a sequence of portfolios (states) where each portfolio depends only on the previous one, which is the characteristic of a Markov chain.
